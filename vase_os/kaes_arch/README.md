# KAES-ARCH
Post Install for vanilla Arch KDE.
A single setup script from a default install.

--- 

### Get the installation medium 

Can download the x86_64 ISO here: [ArchDownload](https://archlinux.org/download/)

> Use [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) or dd to flash USB. Use GPT/MBR appropriate to hardware (usually GPT for most UEFI newer devices). 

Boot off the USB with DEL or f10 or f12 to get to BIOS.

### Setup network 
Ethernet works out of the box. Plug a cable and go. 

> For wifi: `iwctl station wlan0 connect "SSID"` SSID being the name of your WiFi (case sensitive) and it should prompt you for password.

Test: `ping google.com`, you should see `64 bytes from xx.xxx.xxx.xxx (xx.xxx.xxx.xxxx): icmp_seq=1 ttl=109 time=13.9 ms` then it means you are all good to go!

Run `pacman-key --init && pacman -Sy archinstall` then `y`.

Then `archinstall` (for noobs, btw) make sure to go through all the steps:

> Forked our own simplified installer here which you can do to skip most of the steps bellow. [KADEBOOT](https://github.com/h8d13/KADEBOOT)

### Archinstall walkthrough

> You can skip this section if you are familiar with arch installations. 

- Keymap select your own.
- Locales: Use `en_GB.UTF-8` for European format, `en_US.UTF-8` for PM/AM.
> Locale encoding can be left as `UTF-8` if not using some special alphabets.

- Mirrors: Select a region where download speed will be fast.

- For formatting: Use-best effort (This WILL wipe data on this disk)
> I usually use Ext4. (With seperate home partition)

- Swap zram: Enabled (Creates a 4GB in case of memory need)
- Bootloader: Grub 

- Hostname: lowercase and descriptive
- Authentification: Also lowercase. Strong root password.
> Create a user with sudo (required for KDE/SDDM) lowercase.
> Make the password different from root ideally.

- Profile: Type Desktop/Plasma
  - Graphics drivers: select appropriate to your hardware.
  - Greeter: sddm

- Applications: Pipewire for audio as it's dep of KDE + Bluetooth set-up if needed. 
- Kernels: try linux-zen for gaming ! You can even install mutiple and they should show up in your Grub entries.
- Network Configuration: NetworkManager for GUI access.

- Timezone: Select your region in list.
- NTP: Enabled

> Personal preferences for reference. Use your prefered set-ups. Only real dependancy is Sddm and KDE-Plasma. 

IMPORTANT DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS: Make sure to select mirrors, time zone, etc... etc! **Please check you didn't miss any.**

ALSO IMPORTANT! Reboot **to hard disk.** (Make sure to switch boot orders in BIOS, or you install again?)

### After first reboot 

> Login normally using the user you created. This will let KDE create all the files it needs (or I need).
> Also if you are using several screens, make sure to only plug-in the main one at first, you can then plug others ones in after.

#### Get the source code 

Open Konsole.

```
sudo pacman -S git
git clone https://github.com/h8d13/KAES-ARCH
cd KAES-ARCH/
```
Edit the targets: `user` and `kb` using editor of your choice.

#### Edit the source code

`sudo vim post` or `sudo nano post`

```
DTHEME=dark
KB_LAYOUT=us
VARIANT=""
```
> Variant is optional, can be left empty.
> Applies for the current sudo user by default.

> Using vim you can use insert to edit, ESC to enter command mode and :wq to write changes.
> You can also go through some of the rest of the code as there might be some programs you want to add/remove.

#### Run the code

Make exec `sudo chmod +x post` Then run: `sudo ./post`

You are done !

## What the dog doing?

Full source code is available [here](https://github.com/h8d13/KAES-ARCH/blob/master/post) 

All I wanted to be able to do is to install my preferred OS with my prefered DE, but not have to do too many things (I'm lazy and impatient). 
A good example is fresh sessions, when I boot up I wanted a clean Desktop, not to re-open old stuff. 
But over the months it became a lot more tweaks, so I documented them one by one and tested. Until I arrived at a point where I think it's ready. 

### Current Scope

- Keymaps SDDM & KDE
- KDE Default values I didn't like: Empty sessions, Lock-out grace, Powerprofiles, KRunner search
- KDE Dolphin interaction menus
- KDE Look & feel
- SDDM Auto-change theme
- Sysctl & UFW
- Bash/Zsh: Aliases & look-feel
- Pacman GUI

## More useful stuff...

Use `comms` for commands :)

To configure aliases: 
```
alias ecomms="vim ~/.config/aliases"
```

Modify what you need then source: . `~/.config/aliases` 
This should work both for bash and zsh. 

## The 4 shells

Basically sets up zsh and bash for both the user and root. 
And a lot of KDE stuff.

## New context menus!

## Pacman GUI 

Pac2Pac can be found here: [PacToPac](https://github.com/h8d13/PacToPac)

The idea was having a settings section > common operations you do on an arch system to do anything... Flatpak, multi-lib, etc + For people who don't like the terminal, could do common system operations.

### More info:
> Project code name: Winblows

- Arch ISO size: 1,4 GB
- With decent internet total install time should be around 20-30 minutes. With good internet less then 15 minutes. 

> Cool rolling release fact: With Arch in a single command `pacman -Syu` you get system upgrades right at next reboot, but also sometimes even get net negative of update weight meaning your system is now **updated and lighter.**
